# what is this

a collection of "quaint" frontend / javascript librairies.

I'm using a vague/unknowable definition of 'qaint'. whatever inspires quaitness.

a more """formal""" definition:

this is a list of librairies that you could use while making web sites, but shouldn't, but could but shouldn't.

bonus points: if a library can be used multiple / too many times on a web site to the point where it endangers the browsing experience / makes it exciting (I want to feel something dammit)
